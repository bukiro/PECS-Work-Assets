For PECS-Data-Service: 
In the service's main folder:
    npm run publish
    npm run publish-win
In Linux, navigate to the same folder:
    npm run publish-linux
Back in Windows: Make a copy of the publish folder:
Remove all files except service.js, service.exe, service, readme.txt, config.json.example and config.json
Pack both folders into pecs-data-service_<version>.zip

For PECS:
Navigate to the PECS folder:
    npm run publish
    npm run publish-win
In Linux, navigate to the same folder:
    npm run publish-linux
Back in Windows: Make a copy of the publish folder:
Remove all files except src/, pecs.js, pecs.exe, pecs, readme.txt, config.json.example and config.json
Remove src/assets/config.json
Remove all custom data from src/assets/json (search for extensions.json if needed)
Pack both folders into pecs_<version>.zip

Then upload to repositories.
Linux binaries compiled in Windows don't have proper dependencies, so they need to be compiled in Linux.
