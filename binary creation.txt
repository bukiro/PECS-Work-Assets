For PECS-Data-Service: 
In the service's main folder:
    npm run publish
    npm run publish-win
In Linux, navigate to the same folder:
    npm run publish-linux
Back in Windows: Make a copy of the publish folder:
Remove all files except service.js, service.exe, service, readme.txt and config.json.example
Rename the folder to pecs-data-service_<version> and pack it into pecs-data-service_<version>.zip

For PECS:
Navigate to the PECS folder:
    npm run publish
    npm run publish-win
In Linux, navigate to the same folder:
    npm run publish-linux
Back in Windows: Make a copy of the publish folder:
Remove all files except src/, pecs.js, pecs.exe, pecs, readme.txt and config.json.example
Remove src/assets/config.json
Remove all custom data from src/assets/json (search for custom_*.json and extensions.json if needed)
Rename the folder to pecs_<version> and pack it into pecs_<version>.zip

Then upload to repositories.
Linux binaries compiled in Windows don't have proper dependencies, so they need to be compiled in Linux.

The scripts under 'Linux publishing scripts' take care of the linux publishing and the file cleanup. Their paths are scripted for my personal computer.
